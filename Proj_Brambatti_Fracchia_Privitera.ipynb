       " \"Ralphie is a darling black Affenpinscher mix being fostered in Linden, Virginia. His birthdate is December 7, 2013, and he weighs about 14.6 pounds. He has his beautiful natural ears and tail. He is loving, house-trained, active (but not hyper), loves going places, and is very polite in public. He is incredibly incredibly intelligent and a real lovebug! However, he does show fear toward first-time visitors on his own turf and is not social If he meets new people in a neutral space, he is outgoing and a true gentleman, but is leery of new people on his own property. Most of all, he is a total character and will keep you entertained like a court jester!\\n\\n??Ralphie knows all his basic commands and wants nothing more than to please you. One hiccup is that he cannot be placed in a home with other male dogs, but with female dogs, he is their best friend. Ralphie deserves to be the center of attention with a loving family and maybe a sister or two (or just him). Ralphie will do best in an active, adult only home with few hours alone. He is very athletic and needs regular exercise (whether that be a fenced-in yard in which to catch balls or a brisk walk). He loves to run off leash, in a contained area (please no dog parks). Ralphie will â\\x80\\x9cplayâ\\x80\\x9d with cats, he does have a tendency to chase them, but stops on command. He must have a fenced-in yard as opposed to an apartment or condo living situation. Ralphie's intelligence is over the moon, and he can easily climb a 4-foot chain link, so a higher fence (not any type fence he can get his feet into places to climb) will need to be in place for his safety.??\\n\\nHe must always be securely harnessed and leashed when outside a fenced area and crated or seat belted in the back seat when in a vehicle. He will do best with someone who works from home so he can get to know you and go outside often. He is healthy, neutered, UTD on vaccinations, microchipped, heart worm negative, active and healthy.??\\n\\nWe prefer to place Ralphie within 2 hours (120 miles) driving distance of his foster home . A â\\x80\\x9cmeet and greetâ\\x80\\x9d would be ideal at the potential adopter's home and will be required before an adoption can be finalized. Our dogs may never be shipped in cargo and we do not transport them to adoptive homes. They are never placed in homes with invisible (electric) fencing or with intact dogs. Doggy doors are OK as long as they are secured at night and when you are gone. Ralphie is small enough to be attacked by a coyote or other predator so may never be left outside alone. Affenpinschers are sensitive to extreme heat and cold, so care must be taken when you are outside with him on very hot and very cold days.  \\n\\n?Are you the special person who will give Ralphie the loving forever home he is waiting for?\",\n",

Their love for one another was evident in all their interactions, especially by Jake's daily grooming of her. When their owner passed away the siblings returned to the rescue that originally adopted them out (K9 Savior Rescue) and both traveled North in the hopes of finding a retirement home. Unfortunately Jake has recently crossed over the rainbow bridge and now Lily continues her search for a forever home.\\n\\nLily has a sweet, loving demeanor. She appreciates the finer things in life: a good walk, sitting on the deck in the early morning hours with a treat (a coffee for her human companion), and afternoon naps. She is housebroken and likes to be wherever her person is. Lily does well on mini-adventures, which have included trips to Home Depot, friends houses, and local parks. She has also become quite popular with the neighborhood children, and she sits politely while they all take turns petting her. Foster mom has even noticed she picks up her pace when she can see them down the road!\\n\\nLily does get sad when current foster mom goes to work because she would prefer to be with someone, but she is making progress! She is not destructive, and is often found napping on the couch upon return. Her ideal forever home would be a retiree or someone who works part-time, but this is not required!

If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\\n\\nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\\n\\n\\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS: Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\\n\\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\\n\\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\\n\\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\\n\\nAll known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.\\n\\nPaws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.\",\n",

His owner said that he fell out of a truck as a puppy and that is how he lost his back right leg. When Buddy came to us his right eye was open but there was only an infected lump inside and constantly draining so we had the eye surgically removed and stitched up. Buddy is looking and feeling a lot better now and would love to join his new family. He is such an awesome dog and loves attention once he knows you. He is a smart terrier and takes a couple minutes on first meeting to make sure you are safe, but then he is your best friend. He loves to run around after toys in the yard and bounces around you in excitement that you are spending time with him. He is pretty lazy for the most part and loves to lay around. He is not the best on walks and gets his exercise in the yard where he feels comfortable. He was not well socialized or loved as a puppy and has trouble in new environments and with new people. Being at adoptions terrifies him and he just shuts down. Its too many people too fast all at one time for him.  He also hates the cats and is always barking at them. He is also not a fan of other dogs, he wants to be the only spoiled baby in the home. What he craves and what he wants is human attention.

PLEASE SEE CONTACT INFO BELOW. I am the MAHVELOUS Marlena. The shelter sent my picture and write up out several times, but there were no takers. The last time it was sent out, the people in Akita Rescue decided to take me out of the shelter. I had a great shelter evaluation and there was something about me that grabbed their attention...maybe my googly eyes?? My first home took me to the shelter because they 'did not have enough time'. My foster mom thinks it was because I had a huge growth on my foot as well as small lumps in my mammary glands. The large growth was a wart that, once removed, has not grown back. The lumps in my mammary glands are just cysts. I have an A-OKAY health clearance. I combine the best of both breeds. I am Akita sized and a wonderful watch dog. I mostly have the Pittie coat but there is some undercoat. I do shed at the change of seasons. I am not as needy as some Pitties, but not aloof as some Akitas. I love attention, but am willing to occupy myself with toys while laying on my bed if you are busy. I am housebroken and crate trained. The vet staff just ADORE me. I am okay with most of the kitties in the house and can be checked by a word if I look too interested in any of them. I ride fairly well in a car but I will try to get in the front seat if you let me. I am currently being walked on a no-pull harness. I get excited when other dogs call insults to me from behind their fence but mostly walk well on leash. My foster mom has a torn rotator cuff and has not been able to do as much obedience with me as she was. I love treats, so training me is not hard. I have been in rescue for almost a year. I would love to have my own home to live out the rest of my life. If you are looking for a big, good looking lady who is a little goofy for a companion, take a look at me!!

She ignored the other dogs there as long as they kept their distance. She had a laceration on her paw (possibly from fence fighting) and was diagnosed with Lyme disease. The laceration was sewn up and she is being treated for the Lyme disease. Although she is small, she is a little dynamo and likes to be in charge.

The shelter thought she had mammary tumors, but according to our vet, they are cysts. She had a wart on her front paw which has been removed and is now ready to find her new home. She is more active than our Akitas, but does exhibit certain behaviors that show her Akita heritage. She is protective of her territory and will sound off when strangers approach it. She loves people !! just loves people!! She is a little more active than my dogs, but I am used to the calmer Akitas. She passed her temp test at the shelter with flying colors. Her aggression score was 0. She was okay with a large male dog, did not react to the child doll. She is a bit predatory and would be best in a home where there are no small dogs or cats. She will ignore small dogs untless they act aggressively, but her response is easily checked. She will try to chase squirrels while walking and pulls a bit on the lead..working on that. She crates but would rahter be out with her people..does not try to escape or destroy the crate, but can be vocal about getting out at times. She knows commands and since she is food oriented, is an easy train. Her tail is set on 'permanent wag' and will beat you to death with it when she is very happy.

His owners were devastated to have to give him up, but they had a newborn with some special health concerns that made it impossible to keep him.\\n\\nBlake is a very good boy. He is a 2 year old, 92 pound Akita and he is happy and exuberant. He loves all people. He wants to be with you, near you and actually, on you. If you are on the sofa, so is he. Blake knows tons of commands and is exceptionally well-trained. If you have a treat, he'll execute all of his tricks in rapid succession just to get that treat. He is flawless in the house.\\n\\nBlake is probably best in a home with kids over 12. He loves kids, but he is a powerful, active dog and much like a Saint Bernard, he could flatten all but the sturdiest of children. You may have a 6 year old that's a budding lumberjack and that would be fine - know your kids and how they will handle a big dog and then apply.\\n\\nBlake generally likes other dogs, but he is a rough player.

Blake has zero idea how large he is and when he plays, he throws down like the big dog he is (see the video).

WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL, BUT UNLESS YOU FILL OUT AN APPLICATION, WE DO NOT KNOW YOU EXIST. \\n\\nAll known information about an individual dog is provided in its listing. We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters should understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (i.e. a 4-month-old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization.  The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold, for years to come.  Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy.  Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time-consuming and can be expensive. All dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well-socialized dog is more than worth the effort to get them there.\",\n",

       " \"Logan is very playful and has a outgoing personality. He enjoys being rubbed and likes to have a window to look out of. Heâ\\x80\\x99s very submissive and enjoys doing whatâ\\x80\\x99s asked of him especially when thereâ\\x80\\x99s a treat. Logan has an auto immune disease called VKH syndrome ( https://www.marvistavet.com/vkh-syndrome.pml ) which affects the pigment of his skin and without immediate treatment can have a long term effect on the eyes and possible blindness. In terms of medical treatment,  He is currently on a steroid (prednisone) which helps suppress his immune system to stop it from attacking itself. Also on eye medication (prednisone, timolol, and dorzolamide). Pricewise the medications themselves are not costly. As of now, I havenâ\\x80\\x99t spent more than $70 dollars for his medications. The more costly things Iâ\\x80\\x99ve noticed was the actual exam fee. He has dog insurance which covers 90% of his medical expenses excluding the exam fee. Logan knows the sit, stay, lay commands. I'll ask him if he wants water or does he have to use the bathroom and heâ\\x80\\x99ll respond with a whine if he does. Same for food. The type of home I think that would be best suited for him is one where he can both be active and have some time to relax and receive a lot of love and just remain social, whether itâ\\x80\\x99s with kids, other dogs, etc. He is house broken so he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t need to be crated.  \\n\\nThis Akita is located in Rochester, NY.

This bundle of fur and energy is looking for an active family.\\n\\nHugo is a very sociable puppy. He will excitedly greet new people and expect you to have some time to play with him. Hugo would do well in a home with folks who have experience with larger breed dogs. Though not required a fenced in yard is a plus, more importantly is any adopter have the time to mentally and physically stimulate Hugo.\\n\\nHugo loves to play with other dogs and as you might expect with a young dog, he can play a long time. Â\\xa0Hugo is not for someone who is not willing to put in the time and effort to continue his training.  Potential adopters MUST have experience with large breed dogs, preferably an Akita, any Mastiff breed, or any other working dog.\\n\\nAlready, Hugo is walking nicely on a leash (for a 5 month old dog). Â\\xa0He knows all of his basic commands.  He was well socialized as a puppy and is excited to meet new people and new dogs on his walk. However, Hugo can play rough with dogs and people.  He is still learning how to properly use his mouth, so any adopter will need to be patient but firm with Hugo.  \\n\\nHugo is very healthy and is going to grow up to be a big boy, probably close to 90 to 100 pounds and was recently neutered.  He is already about 55 pounds.\\n\\nHugo is available for adoption in New Jersey and Lehigh Valley. If you live outside the area (i.e. central PA, northern Delaware, or southern New York) please email us first before filling out an application. We are note accepting any applications outside of those adoption areas.\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE:\\n\\nAll adopters for Hugo agree to enroll him in an approved obedience training program. Â\\xa0Â\\xa0All adopters must have had prior big dog experience.  If you apply and have not had a large breed dog as your own, we will not process your application.',\n",

       " 'Thor is a very special boy; he is around two years old and is very independent. He didnâ\\x80\\x99t have the easiest upbringing and is cautious around new people. The best way to describe him is that he is learning how to be a dog and still isnâ\\x80\\x99t sure about everything. Once he is comfortable and gets to warm up to you he is very loving and affectionate. \\nThor does get along with most dogs, but prefers to not have them in his space. He will play but does not like to rough house. Toys are something he is still learning, I have seen him play with a ball a handful of times. When Thor is outside, he must be kept on a line or in a fenced in yard and always monitored. Thor thoroughly enjoys the outdoors; being able to zoom around and it always seems like he is keeping a watchful eye on things. Thor walks well on a leash, knows basic commands and will throw a shake in there every now and again when he feels like it. \\nHousehold manners are something that new to him, as it is assumed he was never kept indoors. Thor wears a belly band to prevent marking his territory. He does very well with a crate as that was a problem before. The only thing he does not like is being crowded at the crate or having another animal approaching the crate. \\nNo Cats â\\x80\\x93 he does not want to be their friend\\nNo Children â\\x80\\x93 Thor becomes very defensive to kids, I am not sure why but when he sees a child he barks and growls at them. \\nThor will need to go to a home that has experience with the Akita/Husky breed. He is always perceptive of body language and pushes his boundaries when he feels he is able to do so. He is very vocal and what can come off as a growl is him moaning not wanting to listen. He is very stubborn and will put up a challenge. \\nThor is a work in progress and has a lot of potential. When given time and patients he will become very loving and loyal to his owners.\\n\\nIf you are interested in Thor, please complete an adoption application at www.hhshr.com.',\n",

After spending some time as a city stray, Allie was brought to NYCACC, and quickly rerouted to us for TLC, training and behavior evaluation. Understandably, Allie wasn't her best in the frantic city shelter, but we were delighted that her buoyant, bubbly personality emerged quickly.\\n\\nAllie is 2 years old, and behaves quite like an older puppy. Obviously, she is an energetic girl, who needs sufficient exercise and mental stimulation to maintain good behavior. We would love to see her thrive in the experienced hands of seasoned Northern Breed folks, willing to guide her down the path to Canine Good Citizenship.\\n\\nAllie is a large, powerful girl at 82 pounds. She is an animated, excitable girl, who requires some physical strength and experienced leash handling to manage on lead. Allie is a stunning beauty, who sports the classic Malamute good looks, and big personality. She has a magnificent powerful Malamute stance, and appearance, with big brown eyes. Her thick, full coat has gorgeous black and white markings, and requires regular brushing. Allie can be fussy about having her behind brushed, so adopters will need to be patient with her.\\n\\nAllie is a real people pleaser, and generally appears outgoing and friendly. She bonds quickly, and is an extremely affectionate girl, who needs an experienced Malamute lover to reign in her energy through leadership and ongoing obedience training. Allie would do well with an active single or couple, who have the time to commit to her consistent training. We think an adult home would be the ideal fit for her; the overzealous attentions of small children, and the comings and goings of a busy household might overstimulate her.\\n\\nAllie seems secure in a dog pack, and she has shown some relish in playing with some dogs. As an older puppy, her pack manners are not quite what they should be, so we think that she could do well in a multi-dog home, with savvy adopters, who know how to run a dog pack. Also, we feel that another well-trained, calm dog would be an excellent role model for her. She could also thrive as an only dog, but will need ongoing socialization and training to enjoy the dog park.\\n\\nAllie is an athletic dog, with a high energy level, who requires a couple of vigorous leash walks a day, as well focussed playtime. She would make the ideal running, walking or hiking companion. Allie has excellent stamina and endurance, and will thrive on physical activity, as well as one to one human interaction. Ongoing activity, structure and socializing will help Allie to maintain her good behavior.\\n\\nAllie has a natural affinity for obedience, and has learned her basic commands. She has passed some of her Canine Good Citizenship tests. Motivated adopters will be able to lead Allie all the way to Canine Good Citizen Certification. She has good house manners and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during her transition to a new home. \\n\\nAllie is in good health, has been recently spayed, has been vaccinated for rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus), and canine flu. She has been boostered as needed. She has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis.

       " \"Kaleena, born in December 2013 & weighs about 70 lbs. \\n\\nKaleena is a beautiful girl born June 4, 2013. She is very gentle and affectionate with people. She'll circle around on a walk, come over to sit on your feet. She can be initially shy greeting strangers but definitely warms up quickly. \\n\\nBACKGROUND:  Kaleena came to us from a back yard breeder from which she received little human contact. Initially shy of everything and people she has blossomed into a wonderful happy girl. \\n\\nLIKES:  She loves her walks & does not pull on a leash. She does well in a crate & she views it as her safe place. Kaleena wants the love and attention of humans and loves to roll over for belly rubs, roll around on the cool grass and lean into you for kisses. \\n\\nShe can be frightened of new surroundings and startled easily. With the help of medication, she has been doing really well and they seem to not phase her anymore. We hope with time and patience she will be able to live without medication but she may need it for the rest of her life. \\n\\nKaleena may be able to live with another male companion but we are still working on what will make her the happiest. Will you consider giving her love and patience to watch her love bloom? She is a sweet girl.\\n\\n\",\n",

She is a small girl, weighing in at only 44lbs. Echo is looking for her bucket list buddy .She had bone cancer in her leg and walked around the streets in NC for several months with her leg broke in several places until she came to us at Wolf Spirit Sled Dog rescue. We had her leg amputated and gave her a year longer to enjoy a happy life. She is at the moment a happy active girl that loves car rides and walks. Her chest x-rays are clear. She is also heart worm positive we are doing the slow-kill treatment on her to rid her of those. She would really like a loving home to call her own for what time she has left. Echo is house broke, doesn't seem to mind cats that i have noticed, doesn't mind other dogs as long as they are gentle. We know how hard it is to lose a friend but she would really love a home of her own.E cho is up to date on her vaccines, dewormed, and microchipped. We will send 6 months of heartworm treatment with her. She will need another heartworm test in 6 months which we will pay for. \\n\\nIf interested in Echo please contact Debbie at janrose@swva.net\",\n",
       " \"Maddie is our little Miss Cutie Patootie! She is a short and stocky malamute girl with so much personality. She is guaranteed to make you smile every day with her paw up for high fives and zoomies. Maddie was born October 2011. She is easy and independent. She is called a little miss spit fire, because she is a tough little cookie! She is sassy and all malamute. She enjoys being in her crate and doesn't make a peep. Or hanging outside watching everyone and everything. She also enjoys hiking and just loves the outdoors! She is also happy just laying around on her doggy bed and just being in the same room as you. Don't let that adorable teddy bear look fool you, she isn't a cuddler and prefers her space, EXCEPT when salmon treats are involved. She will come right up to you, give you high fives and show so much excitement for treat time! Just give her space and time to get to know you. She had a very rough life and is hesitant to trust people. Despite this, she sits nicely to put her collar on before going on a walk. She also rides well in car but generally speaking, Maddie doesn't just do things willingly, which is why positive training works well for her. KronchUSA salmon treats really help us encourage Maddie to make good choices. She likes to protest a little bit just enough so she feels like she had a choice.  \\n\\nShe will roll over for belly rubs and come up to you for some love but when shes had enough she will leave and go about her business. She was potty trained at one time but will need a refresher. She does not like other dogs but can be around them. If given the chance she will let other dogs know she is boss and that's why we recommend her as being the only dog in the home. When you are out on a walk she won't get upset seeing another dog as long as they are behaving. She isn't dog aggressive but won't back down from a challenge either. \\n\\nIn May 2017, Maddie had ACL surgery on her right knee and is doing well. Of note, she was debarked as a pup so she doesn't have her 'woowoo' but don't let that stop you from giving this girl her second chance. She needs a home with Northern Breed experience. She has a strict limited ingredient diet --- salmon only protein and fat. Typical malamute she cannot be around small dogs or pets including cats. \\n\\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering this dog, please contact CHAAMP at CHAAMPapplication@gmail.com for an application.

       " 'Sasha is an outdoor dog, but could easily become an indoor dog and deserves it. Currently she is kept in a barn, indoors in a pen at night, where she will wait until she is taken out before going to the bathroom.  We believe she would be easily house trained. In her short time indoors, she was passive and not destructive. At this time, she is taken to an outdoor pen in the morning, with her companion, until nightfall, and returned to the indoor pen at night. She is currently held in a 10 foot tall fenced in area with a lean in and a dig guard. We recommend the same for wherever she goes. She has tested \\\\\"running the fence\\\\\" in hopes of gaining enough momentum to climb over. \\n \\nSasha has a dominant personality, and would do well with a male dog, but would be aggressive toward females dogs.\\n \\nSasha has had little human interaction and craves attention.  She does not like being alone, and requires canine or human companionship. She is extremely excited and grateful for any and all interactions with people she trusts.  She is skittish around new people, but is quick to trust if time is taken with her. She is very smart, a quick learner, and eager to please (I can\\'t express these qualities enough of her). She has taken quickly to basic commands: sit, down, leave it, with me, etc. She does extremely well on a leash with a harness. Without a harness she pulls. \\n \\nSasha truly deserves a loving and caring home. She is a cuddle bug and has a very sweet, submissive disposition around us. She has a beautiful howl that she uses to call her companion when separated, or to tell us she is upset in some way. She loves to play and really enjoys the snow. She is submissive during play with her companion, however has no problem putting him in his place if need be.\\n \\nSasha is food aggressive and does not tolerate raw meat (it needs to be cooked or she vomits), and needs something other than dry kibble in her dish. We have been browning hamburger or boiling chicken breasts to add to her twice daily meals.\\n \\nAll in all, we believe the perfect placement for Sasha, other than being placed with her companion, would be to a home that can provide her constant attention that an indoor dog would receive. She sits longingly looking into the house when we are not present with her outside.  If she is to be an outdoor dog, she would definitely need a companion. \\n \\nSasha has quickly become the \\\\\"stand out\\\\\" of all the animals at our farm, if that gives you any insight on her personality. We call her the \\\\\"sweet one\\\\\". \\n \\nMiscellaneous items of note: Sasha is up to date on her vaccinations.  As of February 21, 2019, she is currently at the 60 day point of a 120 day treatment cycle for heart worm. If at 120 days she still tests positive, the treatments are redone. If she is negative, she will be spayed if she is not in heat at that time.\\n\\nUp for adoption in the New England area',\n",

He would do well in a home where someone could spend most of the day with him. He is looking for someone experienced with large dogs or northern breeds. Typical male malamute characteristics. He has moments of zoomies and then would lay next to you and watch TV. Apollo is an expert digger and occasionally tries to dig inside and outside.

He could never live with another male due to male-male aggression nor be around another male dog unsupervised. Apollo does mark in the house, but most likely this is due to the presence of another large male sharing the house. He will wear a belly band but that does not deter his marking. During walks, Apollo avoids other dogs except for his two husky friends. He responds well to the dog walker and loves to give kisses. \\n\\nApollo loves all toys. He always has a toy in his mouth and wants to play fetch or get pets while he chews them. He is a good sitter and will do almost anything for a treat.

       " 'Born in 2017, Finn is a small pup who weighs around 55 lbs. Just a petite bundle of stunning WHITE fur with little slivers of chestnut on the top of his ears. He stays clean too. He can be shy & even fearful of some humans or just lean into you as he melts to the floor with his belly up for affection. Because he can be fearful of \\\\\"some\\\\\" people it\\'s important to give him \\\\\"space\\\\\" and go slow with introductions. He has met older children and enjoyed their calm attention but to help him with his excitability he prefers a home with older children. He has blossomed with positive dog training (no force, no fear, no pain) and build his confidence while strengthening your bond. Finn is seeking his human soulmate. He is an amazing young boy & is waiting patiently for the right home.\\n\\nOTHER DOGS: Currently, if we can\\'t avoid a dog during our walk, then we keep a safe distance like on the other side of the street, in a calm voice tell him he is a good boy, watch, & we toss a treat in the air for him to catch. We allow Finn to watch the dog, but break his stare with something positive to change the experience. This also helps him refocus his energies to something delicious. With \\\\\"some\\\\\" dogs, this has worked well. There are still some dogs that he reacts to due to fear.  Finn tends to be intimidated by large dogs & can\\'t help but want to chase small dogs, which is completely natural for Northern Breeds. He has met playful females and has done well with a slow introduction. He has also met some that made him fearful.  \\n\\nINSIDE THE HOUSE:  Finn is calm inside the house as long as he gets a nice walk. We also give him a frozen toy filled with chicken broth & a couple of treats, which he loves to lick. Licking is very soothing to dogs & helps them stay busy. He enjoys chewing & licking toys. We always leave his crate open and he is kept in a gated area during the day, which is the kitchen as well as Finn\\'s den. He is a very good boy & tries not to counter surf. He enjoys jumping on furniture & can learn which sofa is his spot.\\n\\nBACKYARD FUN:  Finn enjoys your company while he runs around in the backyard. He enjoys keeping the garden free of critters, bugs, & eating fresh tomatoes off the vine. Thanks to Finn, the garden have survived! Finn hopes to have a fenced yard, so he can sniff and show you his zoomies, be your gardening assistant. He loves going outside & sprinting in happiness, especially in the winter!  He also loves to lay on his Kuranda dog bed under the shade after sipping water in between his own party in the backyard. He likes to play hide & go seek too. He also enjoys nuzzling his head in between your legs for affection in between his fun time. Just an amazing companion.   \\n\\nFinn typically walks a mile 3 times a day. He sits nicely (with his paw up as if to say please hurry) for treats too. He has great potential & learns quickly too. The husky side of Finn is excitable. So it\\'s important to help him practice calming down by asking for a sit, then a down, and then zen with long strokes on his back or a belly rub. He loves this & often melts into your side, then your feet with his belly up for love. In a new environment, it is important to remind him how to relax. He is a complete angel with his foster family, but they follow these guidelines earned his trust. He enjoys being with his foster family and is very affectionate. He loves to sleep on the bed & will initiate affection for a while, then goes to his side of the bed to sleep.  \\n\\nTRAVEL COMPANION: Finn also travels well. He prefers to be seated close to his foster family. He is a family dog and loves with all his heart. \\n\\nTOYS & PLAY:  Finn likes squeaky tough toys (he destroys stuffed animals in seconds) and will trade his toy for a treat with no problem. He is quite playful & loves to smell & find things. He would do well-performing nose work. Finn enjoys being a \\\\\"good boy\\\\\" & loves working for a reward. It\\'s important to provide with Finn a calm demeanor and go slow to help him blossom. Finn likes to play the \\\\\"find it\\\\\" game and he also likes to sit, wait, and catch a treat as you toss it in the air. He loves rotisserie chicken sandwiches, which he considers a high-value treat. We use it when counter conditioning scary things like dogs. \\n\\nSPACE: When introducing Finn to new things, we practice letting him go at his own pace and treating, repeat, etc. This has built his confidence. Trust is important for Finn. It is important to give him space and allow him to enter into your space when meeting him. Finn like most dogs does not like having his head pat by, especially strangers. \\n\\nWe believe Finn is part Husky/Malamute, his Malamute side likes to keep his distance from other male dogs. His foster mom simply calls him and lets him sniff rotisserie chicken sandwich as she lures him to walk in a different direction (\\\\\"this way\\\\\"), he is rewarded with small bites. He responds nicely! He has so much potential. \\n\\nBACKGROUND:  Finn came to CHAAMP after living with a family on a farm with fur siblings. He was too interested in the chickens and the cats. He also wasn\\'t getting along with the male dogs in the household. He was said to have high predatory behavior, which is normal for Northern Breeds. Finn can go from 0 to 70 in a blink of an eye due to excitement or if you go too fast and scare him. \\n\\nFinn\\'s foster family has gone slow, provided structure, and practice positive dog training to help him make good choices. He is an amazing & affectionate young furry companion who loves his foster family & is seeking to fall in love with a special human.   \\n\\nIf you are interested in adopting Finn, please contact CHAAMP at CHAAMPapplication@gmail.com for an application.

He is a free spirit who responds beautifully to pawsitive communication. He enjoys chasing and burying balls (especially squeaky balls) and really enjoys going out on hikes exploring.

He enjoys just being where you are & hanging out. He has been receiving positive training and has learned to redirect his excitement by sitting for a treat and sitting so the car door opens for an adventure. Most recently he is learning to relax, which he enjoys with chicken sandwich bite size rewards. Bucky looks like a very tall Siberian Husky. Bucky would benefit from pawsitive reinforcement training classes and someone with a good sense of humor. Bucky just wants to have fun, so learning how to communicate being consistent & calm works great for Bucky, especially with a soft yummy treat. \\n\\nWith so much to give, he definitely will make someone happy once he settles in and knows he's loved. He prefers to be the only pet in the home...who doesn't like to be the star of the show?!?!  We recommend reading, Positive Perspectives 2 - Know your Dog Train your Dog by Pat Miller.

       " 'Boris is primarily an outdoor dog with the potential to be an indoor dog.  He is high maintenance both behaviorally and physically, but in relatively little time has come a very long way. \\n \\nBoris is a bull. I do not personally walk him due to his strength.  He is currently held in a 10 foot tall fenced in area with a lean in and a dig guard. We recommend the same for wherever he goes. We have nick named him Taz. He has absolutely tested \\\\\"running the fence\\\\\" in hopes of gaining enough momentum to climb over. He has eaten through the original fencing (14 gauge), so we have had to add additional cattle fencing on top of the original fencing to contain him.\\n \\nBoris does not do well with other male dogs, and originally did not do well with our horse or mini-donkey.  Boris is overall easily excitable/anxious around any other animal other than his companion or in new situations.  He is extremely smart and could be trained to do just about anything in his constant efforts to please, be praised, and loved.\\n \\nWe believe he has had little human interaction prior to his placement. Due to this, he craves attention. He is extremely excited and grateful for any and all interactions with people he trusts. When he and his companion are separated for any length of time, they give multiple hugs and show sheer playful excitement upon being returned to each other. He is skittish around new people, and takes a bit more time to trust. He is extremely smart, a quick learner, and eager to please (I can\\'t express these qualities enough of him). He sincerely just wants to be loved and hugged all the time. He begs to not go in the outdoor pen in the morning, molding, laying on his back or jumping up to hug. He has clearly not received a lot of attention, and if the person that he bonds with is willing to spend a lot of time with him, I see him quickly settling down and being a simply stunning animal. Boris is anxious by nature and has bad puppy manners that we are working on. Nipping is his first defense when anxious and commands are ignored. Time needs to be taken to calm his fears before handling him if he is anxious. Once you are able to calm him and gain his attention, you don\\'t lose it. He has quickly learned sit, down, leave it, with me, no bite, easy, etc., and does extremely well on a leash with a harness. Without a harness he literally chokes himself. \\n \\nBoris truly deserves a loving and caring home. He is a cuddle bug and is truly a very sweet boy. Boris is puppy like and playful. He runs laps, plays and enjoys the snow. He is a high energy dog that would do well with an active person. Boris is submissive to his mother\\'s jealousy when being paid attention to and backs off.  He was for a time, jealous when the other animals (horse & mini-donkey) were being fed, however, if we spoke to him in a calming tone and acknowledge him, he quickly settled.  \\n \\nWe have always fed Boris separately. Boris is also food aggressive, but can be fed and will eat just about anything. Boris does well with treats in his companion\\'s presence. \\n \\nAll in all, we believe the perfect placement for Boris, other than being placed with his companion, would be a single animal home with a ton of time, patience and love to give. We do see him as potentially being an indoor dog, if once again, he is bonded to someone that is willing to train him. The person or persons for his adoption do have some training ahead but we are confident that with the right placement that would happen very quickly. If he is to be an outdoor dog, he would need a companion animal.\\n \\nOf note, we fear that Boris could quickly become misunderstood and therefore mishandled. Not that there isn\\'t extra care in all placements, but we feel there is an added level of care that will need to be taken in his placement to ensure his well-being. \\n\\nUp for adoption in the New England area',\n",
       " 'Kilo is a very mellow senior fellow. He is in foster care so we do know a lot about him. Kilo knows sit, wait, hungry, go outside/walk, move, and up. He enjoys car rides, quiet time, toys, walking, and water. Kilo would do best in a home with no other animals, but he does currently live with a dog brother and does ok. His dog brother however, does not bother with Kilo, basically ignores him, and that seems to be the situation that works best. No cats. Kilo does well with older kids and adults, but can best be described as aloof. He will not pester you for attention, he is ok with his own company. Kilo is food aggressive with other dogs, but doesn\\'t have any aggression with people.Because of Kilo\\'s age and size, he does have some issues with mobility. He can walk just fine, but stairs are a problem. He needs help to use them, and at his size, 95 lbs, he is a heavy load. So, preferably a living situation with no stairs.Kilo is housebroken and is \\\\\"impeccably well behaved in the house\\\\\".',\n",

I was fed garbage and rotten food and I was supposed to be made into soju elixer. Sadly my mom went to the meat market and it was too late to save her.

I am so lucky to get a one way ticket to come to Seattle to find a new forever home! Take me on car rides, walks in the park and I will become your very best friend. I get along well with people of all ages, gentle kids and other dogs. I am trained and extremely smart and I need a home with a fenced in yard.

Her only negative is she has some separation anxiety, fear of loud noises and she has extreme fear of storms. She needs to be kenneled when left alone. She's scared of a leaf blower. They terrify her. She has been known to break through a door to get away from one. Lawn mowers, vacuums, weed eaters, etc are fine, just leaf blowers. During a storm, she feels she needs to get away from it. She might try to get out of her kennel if she's left alone in a home. But if she's with someone, she is ok.

She can't tell me what her life was like... But her body painted a not so wonderful picture of what life must have been like. \\n\\nI immediately took her to the vet upon leaving the shelter. We found out she was in fact diabetic. It had clearly gone without treatment for some time. On top of nursing several litters of puppies her body had wasted away & left her very malnourished. \\n\\nWithin 1 month my girl had gained 6 lbs & had so much more energy & light in her eyes! She is the SWEETEST DOG! I can't even put into words how much I love her & how she deserves the world! She is 100% dog friendly but does best with neutral dogs that won't try to dominate her. She is also not a big fan of puppy energy bouncing in her face LOL After being a momma to I can only imagine how many pups- I don't blame her there! \\n\\nCats are unknown. She is great with people of all ages. \\n\\nShe is crate trained & knows some basic commands. She is not a huge fan of walks as she tires out easily but does great on the leash. For the most part she just wants to lay at my feet or cuddle up next to me in bed. \\n\\nMyla requires insulin shots twice a day with her meals 12 hours apart. This is VERY inexpensive ($40 a month). She takes her shots very well & doesn't even flinch. & YES I can train you how to do this if you've never done it. I was SCARED at first when I heard her diagnosis as I'm petrified of needles! Trust me when I say this is EASY! So don't let it cause you to pass her by! \\n\\nAre you the home for our middle aged queen? Let me know! She is 8 years old.

Pinky's perfect home is as an only dog so she can get all the fun, all the attention, and all the love!\\n\\nPinky is crate-trained, house-broken, spayed, microchipped, and up to date on her vaccines.  Her adoption fee is $250.  If you're interested in making Pinky a part of your family please complete an application at happytailsaz.org.\",\n",

       " \"China has a sad story... She once had a home. Her family seemed to love her but hard times fell upon them and they had to move... China could not come. The family did the right thing, and instead of taking her to the pound they re-homed her to somebody they thought would care for her. They were wrong. After animal control found her roaming multiple times, finally the family decided they did not want to fix their fence to keep China from roaming. County then picked up China and gave the family a chance to come and pick her up, they decided not to come for her. After evaluation, China was placed on the kill list at the pound because of a medical condition - Entropion. Which means that her eye lids flip inward and rub the eye raw. After all she has been through, we could not let her die like that. She has had the surgery to correct this condition and she is doing great and can now see again perfectly. China is a beautiful dog! She is very playful and loves playing with all of her friends! She loves to go on walks, play with toys, swim and get all kinda of loving! China would make a great addition to any family. She is house and kennel trained, walks well on a leash and knows basic commands.

Sookie is an 8 year old female Boxer blend. On intake, she was extremely underweight, and she has cataracts that make it difficult to see. It has been determined that she is also a diabetic, and a new family should know that she will require insulin as part of her daily care.

To Sookie, there aren't too many things greater in life than cuddling with the nearest human or playing with a fun toy! Speaking of toys, Sookie loves a good game of tug-of-war or a round of squeaking her favorite squeaky toy. She also enjoys walks full of exploring and sniffing and is more than willing to accompany you on an easy hike with some more leash training.\\nSookie is very tolerant of all kinds of petting, even some attention that might annoy some dogs. She does occasionally play a little rough so, supervision around the little ones is never a bad idea. She really\\nenjoys interacting with other dogs, especially those who want to play with her. Once introductions are done she is happy to play with her canine buddy or simply relax on the couch next to them.\\nSookie has what some consider a complicated relationship with cats. She desperately wants to play with them but in true Boxer form, she doesn't seem to understand that hissing and swatting isn't playing. A kitty that loves playtime as much as her would be a dream come true to Sookie.\\nSookie has made huge strides in her leash walking but, her cataracts do inhibit\\nher vision somewhat so unexpected objects in her path may trip her up.\\nIn other areas she is a lady. She waits patiently (with the exception of a few grumbles) for her food and allows you to take it away with nothing worse than a pout.

As part of the adoption agreement, adopters agree to get the pup spayed/neutered and provide K-9 Lifesavers with proof of spay/neuter. K-9 Lifesavers does not cover the cost of spay/neuter for puppies 6 months or younger.\\n\\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home.

They were the only survivors of their litter, born in a rural shelter. They are very happy and sweet girls in spite of their rough start!! Currently being fostered in a home with lots of dogs, they love to play and snuggle, both with the other dogs and their humans!! Puppies are a lot of work, so be sure you have the time (and energy) to devote to raising a young pup!!\\n\\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\\n\\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, rabies (if puppy is old enough), distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing (if puppy is old enough), monthly heartworm prevention while in our care, monthly flea/tick prevention while in our care, and our transport costs. As part of the adoption agreement, adopters agree to get the pup spayed/neutered and provide K-9 Lifesavers with proof of spay/neuter. K-9 Lifesavers does not cover the cost of spay/neuter for puppies 6 months or younger.\\n\\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home.

This dog is available at the Small Miracles rescue facility in Ellicott City.  To submit an application, please come meet this dog in person.  You can bring your application with you, or you can fill one out when you come in.  Dogs will be removed from PetFinder only when they have an approved application or more than three (3) interested applicants.\\n\\nWhere did this dog come from?...  We rescue dogs from 100% kill shelters in West Virginia and on occasion from Kentucky.  On rare occasions we accept owner surrenders.  Due to the nature of the shelters they were rescued from, we often do not know the dogs\\' history.\\n\\nHow Old is this dog?...  We look at a dogs\\' teeth to estimate its age, and then the age is reevaluated by our veterinary staff when the dog is spayed/neutered.  If an age is not posted online, please feel free to inquire.\\n\\nIs this dog Good With Kids?...  We occasionally know for sure if a dog is good with kids because it came from a home with kids.  This is rare.  We always suggest you bring your children in to meet the dog if you are seriously interested in adopting.  Dogs may like some kids and may dislike others.  Dogs are individuals, just like kids are.\\n\\nIs this dog Housebroken?...  Advice from a veterinarian:  Even if a dog is housebroken at my house, it does not mean that it understands not to pee at someone else\\'s house.  It ONLY understands not to pee at my house.  Some dogs make the connection that they should only pee outside.  Some must be retrained when they come home.  All we can tell you for sure is whether/or not a dog\\'s crate is clean when we come to walk them in the AM.  All this means is that they are crate trained and waited to pee until we took them outside.\\n\\nWhat is this dog\\'s Temperament?...  We do not have a clear picture of a dog\\'s temperament until we have allowed them to settle in for a few days.  Even then they are living in a shelter environment with many other dogs and a lot of daily activity.  It can be difficult to say a dog is \\\\\"calm\\\\\" or \\\\\"nervous\\\\\" when the shelter environment is playing a big role in that behavior.  We only rescue FRIENDLY dogs who have no known bite history.  If a dog is at Small Miracles, it likes people and has a good temperament.  We always suggest you meet the dog to see if it is the right fit for your lifestyle. \\n\\nWhat are your Fees?...  Base adoption fee is $325 for adult dogs and puppies.  To this, we add a $30 microchip fee, which we register for you, and a 6 month supply of heartworm preventative.  Heartworm preventative costs $40-60 depending on the weight of the dog.  This means that a large dog will total $405.00 and an extra large dog will total $415.00.\\n\\nWhy can\\'t I adopt a FREE dog?...  Our adoption fee covers many procedures which cost much more for us then the amount we ask for from you. We spay/neuter all pets, and we give them their first round of vaccines (canine distemper, bordatella, Rabies if age appropriate).  At a typical vet clinic this would cost you $500 at minimum for the surgery, and each vaccine is roughly $35 each.  Even if your adopted dog does not have all of its shots due to the mandatory waiting period between booster shots, we offer vaccinations at the low cost of $15/shot.  We test all dogs for heartworm disease and tickborn illnesses such as Lymes.  We never euthanize a heartworm positive dog, and treatment routinely costs us $3000/dog.  We collect a fecal sample from every rescued dog and run a microscopic parasite test.  Any parasites found will be treated with two rounds of the appropriate dewormer.  We treat all dogs for fleas and ticks with Advantage.  If a dog has significant dental disease or \\\\\"very dirty teeth\\\\',\n",

She acts like a much younger dog who is raring to go, and has tons of love to give.\\n\\nAngel spent almost 6 years of her life crated in a basement. She lived her first 2 years coexisting well with another small dog in her family, but she lost her home and was adopted by a family with small dogs. Angel had some reactivity to the other small dog in her home, and found herself confined to a crate and mostly separated from her family. Angel's mom loved her, but was also sickly, and unable to give her the time, affection, and daily exercise this active dog needs. Angel was starved for attention when she first came into rescue, and is a very affectionate, loving dog. When we met her to do her photo shoot, we took her out for the first walk she'd in years and you could just see the joy on her face.\\n\\nWe lucked out in finding an excellent only dog foster home for this sweet girl, and becuase of their commitment, Angel now has the opportunity to have a better life. Senior dogs like Angel make excellent companions; they are confident in their skin, grateful for a loving and safe home, and are happy to go for a walk or lounge on the sofa next to you. At shelters, seniors are the least likely to be adopted and the first to be euthanized. Fostering or adopting a senior dog is your opportunity to be a hero and get a wonderful companion in return.\\n\\nAngel settled in quickly to her foster home, and now has people who love her and treat her like family. She shares a warm bed every night with her teenage brother, and gets regular daily walks and playtime. She's crate and potty trained and has wonderful house manners. She can be reactive to other dogs on leash, and her foster mom, Sherry, is working to address this behavior. We feel an active, only dog home would best suit Angel right now, and a fenced yard will be ideal.\\n\\nAngel has been fully integrated into her foster family for almost 2 years.

This cute gal is looking for a new home...she\\'s super sweet and good with people once she trusts them and other dogs. Cricket will do well with a patient adopter willing to give her time to adjust.\\n\\nCricket is a quirky girl, she isn\\'t a super outgoing & she is very shy, but she makes up for it in the most affectionate ways. She must go to a home with another dog. Another dog will show her that people are okay and will show her the ropes of a new home. Cricket has been living in a foster home with a family, multiple dogs and a cat. Cricket is a great couch cuddler and her favorite place is sitting under the table waiting for her tiny human to drop some food! Can you give Cricket a forever home? Email us & talk to her foster mom for more information.\\n\\nYour new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.\\n\\nAdoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.\\n\\nFoster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home.

She is one of the happiest, wiggliest foster dogs ever. Her personality is spectacular and she will deeply love whoever her person is. She's so fun to watch with her exuberance and play style. She'll make you laugh, she'll make you wanna snuggle all the time, she'll make you wanna stop in your tracks and tell her how adorable she is... she's amazing.\\n\\nOn her own, she's a well behaved dog. She knows sit, stay, and paw and will stay right next to me in the yard if asked to. She's extremely quiet in the house and doesn't bother with counter surfing or getting into tempting things. She's pretty good walking on the leash, especially when there are no distractions. She loves running free in the yard and her picky foster mom insists on a fenced yard for her. She has a strong prey drive. Off leash in an open space is not an option for her.\\n\\nDespite being so adorbs, Roxy must learn she does not get to call the shots. She needs a firm, strong owner who can direct her to be the good dog she clearly can be, and not allow Roxy to steam roll the relationship. Someone who knows how to ignore a dog when the dog is overly excited, someone who knows it's OK to tell a stranger 'no, you cannot pet my dog', someone who isn't going to let Roxy get everything she wants, whenever she wants it but knows it's important that you make the decision about what Roxy needs. With the right owner, Roxy is an absolutely remarkable dog. With a weak, scared owner, Roxy tries to rule the roost but doesn't know enough about how to do that.\\n\\nRoxy was evaluated by a dog trainer. The trainer said it would take a special dog for Roxy to live with. Because we want Roxy's next home to be her last home, we'd prefer that Roxy be an only dog. We are working on her dog socialization but she needs a lot of work to live with another dog peacefully. She is not a dog for dog parks.\\n\\nRoxy will be available for adoption around mid-August.To be considered for adoption, you must apply using our free, online application. Our dogs are fostered in our volunteers' homes, not in a central shelter/location. Only approved applicants are put into contact with the foster family to setup a meeting with the foster dog.

Dogs with DCM can live a full happy life.\\nShe also has severe elbow and hip dysplasia. She\\'s doing very well with daily supplements and pain medications.

Iris\\' only desire in life is to give love and get love. She is the best cuddle bug! She likes to hang in the kitchen and watch all the action hoping to be the taste tester! When greeting you returning home from work or even just waking in the morning, Iris is so happy to see you!

She is underweight at 35 pounds and will require 3 meals a day. She is quiet,sleeps a lot and the only issue we have seen is some guarding of her xpen area when other dogs nose around.

If you are interested in Brew and have experience with English Bulldogs please contact us. PUPDATE. Brew has been with us for almost a week. She has seen our vet.

This makes them lovely family dogs and watchdogs, even for families with children, but they will need socialization training, especially as puppies to get along with unfamiliar humans or other dogs that stop by for a visit. Luckily, their intelligence makes them highly adaptable and trainable. The American Bulldog is a playful breed that has some high exercise needs, and they do well in families that are able to stay active with lots of walks and play time. They aren't the best breed to be kept in apartments or small spaces that don't allow for them to burn off energy. When they aren't physically or mentally stimulated, they can become destructive and chew on things they aren't supposed to. They CAN NOT be kept outside and are intolerant of heat. \\n\\nPucci,  will make a wonderful family addition that is committed to a puppy, their energy, training needs and that us the right fit for his breed.

She's always been in a household with other dogs and we get along great. I do get along better with dogs and not cats. No cats!! Don't crate me-I have wonderful house manners and don't need to be crated, and it upsets me to be in a small space. I ride well in the car and enjoy going places. I have a moderate energy level and love to hang around the house as well as hang around the yard. I'm absolutely a great girl!!! I would love a family to forever be a part of!!! Currently in a foster home, so call Laura at 803-315-2021 if you ae interested in making an appointment to visit me. Thank you!!! Hugs and kisses! Caden    (Estimated DOB:2/18/2017).

I am putting her up for adoption, because the only way we are certain she will not find a home, is if we don't give her a chance. Buffy came from animal control, very pregnant, she had 7 healthy puppies a few day after we sprang her from the pound( thanks to our great foster dawn for letting Buffy have the pups at her home). Buffy was due to be euthanized the day we pulled her, because of how old her pups were, it would take them an hour or more to die inside her body, thatâ\\x80\\x99s why it is so hard to not save the expecting moms. The fact that we still solve pet over population problems by killing them is truly baffling and of course heartbreaking...So her pups grew up, they were very healthy and she was a good mom, all the babies found great homes. Buffy comes back to rescue, and she is just a pill, really. She pretty much hated most other dogs, she is very loving and affectionate to people until they try to make her do something she is not interested in doing, then she turns into a little gremlin. She is terrible with cats and for obvious reasons, no kids.....But she has a really sweet side, and she is sad, and needy in a way, she wants what they all want, some one to love her for who she is, good and bad.

Not so much for our 2-3 year old Harley Quinn who seems to be caught in a revolving door to the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center. She has been with us before and although we had all hoped she had found her forever, none of her previous homes ended up being that perfect match. So we start over again. HARLEY QUINN IS A HAPPY GIRL. Her smile goes pretty much from floppy ear to floppy ear and her eyes smile right along with those pearly whites. She is very energetic with lots of energy enabling her to run all around given the opportunity. She's still young and oh so active so right from the start we need an active family willing to include her in any outings, vacations or just running up the street to drop off the movie at the Red Box. I saw how much fun she has running around a big yard all over the place! She loves to play fetch and she is good at it, too! Harley is very friendly, she loves everyone! She loves kids, cats and dogs! Although she does loves those kids, she is probably best with older children as her energy level may be a bit too much for the younger ones. We still suggest bringing in any resident dog and kids to meet her just to be extra sure they are fine together. Remember you should still supervise and not leave anyone alone for a little while as it's all going to be new for our Harley. She is only 2 -3 years old and doesn't need to be sitting in a cage any longer. If you're looking for a friendly, happy, all around well behaved good girl, you have to meet Harley Quinn. We are told she had shown signs of food and toy aggression in her previous home which is why they surrendered her. We have not seen that behavior since she's been with us at the Virginia Beach Animal Care and Adoption Center, 341 S Birdneck Road but you should still be aware of this and willing and able to handle it if you see it. This last surrender was because her family had orders to move to California and they were unable to take her. If you think you'll be moving and feel it may be difficult to bring a pet with you, please just share our girl and come in to volunteer with us! We need a stable home for Harley Quinn. It's not fair she keeps coming back. Harley's id number is 1908-1721. She's currently in a back kennel waiting for a space in adoption so if you don't see her, please just ask! Someone will be happy to get her for you.\",\n",

I was originially found as a stray with two other dogs, but I can be selective on who my new canine friends are. So lets have a play date before we all go home together. I could do well with kids, as long as they don't see me as a pony or a trampoline. My hips have some wear and tear, so I'd like to avoid an excess amount stairs in my forever home. There are two things that will maximize my quality of life: daily joint supplements and an occasional Vet checkup/prescription when I start to show pain in my legs. If interested in giving me a warm, safe place to rest my body please ask a Caretaker for a meet and greet with me!\",\n",

Cammie is good with other dogs but can seem a little stalker-ish/stand off-ish when first meeting a new dog. Once she realizes she is okay, though, she seems more disinterested in them and leaves the other dog trying to get her to focus to engage in play :) Cammie is good with all kinds of people and is house and crate trained. She can be a little pulley on the initial start of a walk, but she typically settles in really well after the first few minutes.

She loves men and women equally.    \\n \\nLuna has  POKA DOT EARS AND FRECKLES and is SO ADORABLE IN PERSON, SHE\\'S what Iâ\\x80\\x99d call  A \\\\\"COMFORTABLE DOGâ\\x80\\x9d.\\nShe\\'s so loyal and devoted.    We\\'ve determined that she is best with one person, even a Veteran or Couple and she adores CATS!  She lived with dogs when she fostered and was fine.   Lunaâ\\x80\\x99s former owners said she loved to be part of any activity, but they were â\\x80\\x9cnever home to give her attention she needsâ\\x80\\x9d -- so they gave her up to the shelter. But Luna didnâ\\x80\\x99t understand: She spent her first couple of  days crying both in her pen and while outside and seemed to be constantly searching passing cars for her people.  She is a very devoted and loyal girl.\\n \\nâ\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s a great pup â\\x80\\x93 very loving â\\x80\\x93 and would made a great additionâ\\x80\\x9d to a family, one of her former owners said on Lunaâ\\x80\\x99s pet history form. The ex-owner reported that Luna was housebroken, stayed in the house during the day and in bed at night. She lived with a cat. She likes rope toys and playing fetch and was okay when left alone. The adjectives the previous owner chose to describe her included: obedient, affectionate, friendly and playful.  She is also protective.\\n \\nAt the shelter a volunteer wrote  â\\x80\\x9cLuna is a total sweetheart,â\\x80\\x9d said an experienced volunteer. â\\x80\\x9cShe is easy to walk, calm and quiet. She loves attention and petting and leans in to get as close as possible. She was interested in a dog that walked by the play yard -greeting with wagging tail â\\x80\\x93 but then came back to me for attention. She also met a gentleman who talked to her and she pushed herself against the fence trying to get close to him.  Another volunteer said. â\\x80\\x9cA very sweet girl â\\x80\\x93 she knows sit, paw and down and he loves to sunbathe.  She showed no reaction to her feet and mouth being handled, maintained a relaxed body stance when touched and licked the face of the handler when looked in the eyes. She calmly allowed her food to be removed and was willing to let go of a toy.            She is a wiggly happy sweetheart of a girl.  Calm and Gentle and just happy to be part of a family.  Everything you want in a dog is in Luna.  Ask for her videos!  I prefer not to place Luna with children, sheâ\\x80\\x99s much calmer around adults and loves cats. Ask for her adorable video!\\n\\nIf you would like to adopt Luna please contact Jennifer Gordon at 203-246-4681.  She is being fostered in Rowayton, CT.',\n",

She was found as a stray but has been in foster care, so we have learned a lot about her. She loves all people but might be a little timid when she first meets you. After that, she is trying to give you as many kisses as possible. Salsa is stubborn like a typical bulldog, but she knows some commands and will sit and wait for a long time for her meals. She hasn't shown any resource guarding with people, but she is a little possessive of her toys with other dogs. She has been in 2 foster homes and gotten along with her foster siblings, however she needs to be with a more submissive doggie sibling. Salsa is a dominant girl and wants to be the boss. She is great in her crate and has had no accidents in her crate, but her house training isn't 100% yet. This is something her new family will need to continue working on when she comes home. Salsa is in a foster home, so contact the shelter to get in touch with her foster mom!\",\n",

I think some people see me and are intimidated by my breed and size, but I\\'m really a sweet, smart girl. Being in the kennel for so long has been pretty hard on me, but I still manage to win the hearts of shelter workers and volunteers alike when I\\'m out of my cage.\\n\\nBeing between 2-3 years old, I am energetic and spritely; they say I\\'ve got the best zoomies in the shelter right now! In spite of how young I am, I am a gem around adults and I take directions very well. It\\'s true, I am eager to please (especially if it gets me a Nylabone or an extra walk). When my energy is depleted, I become a world-class snuggler and at 80 lbs, I am scientifically at prime snuggling weight. I am leash-trained and was previously house-trained, but I may need a refresher course once I am out of the shelter and in your (our) lovely home. \\n\\nAfter much consideration, I have decided that I would do best as an only pet. After being around so many dogs and cats for so long, I really just need to feel special and loved with my human family. It would be best for me to be in a family with no children who are younger than teenagers. \\n\\nIf you\\'d like to meet me, take me out for a walk, or witness my world-class zoomies in person, please come down to SVASC and ask for Dixie!\\n\\nTo find out more about my backstory, meet me, take me out for a walk, or witness my world class zoomies....\\\\',\n",

He will fall on his back with his legs in the air for morning belly-rubs, he adores them.  Since his head and neck are the same diameter, he has learned to back out of a collar. I tried a harness on him, and he had chewed it off in a few minutes. Homie\\\\\" is neutered, current on all shots, on flea and tick killer and heartworm negative, and on meds to prevent heartworms.  He is a good eater, not finicky at all.

I spent most of my life living in an outdoor pen in Kansas being used as a stud dog, so I need some special considerations when it comes to my perfect forever home! I've adjusted to normal life quite well, really. Sometimes I still get startled in new environments, or when I see something new, but its not really because I'm afraid..its just because I've never seen it before! I recover very quickly and have never shown any defensive tendencies like growling or barking. I just need a patient hand that will let me investigate the new thing and see what its all about! I also really need someone that is willing and able to continue the potty training work I've been doing with my foster mom. I'm learning, but undoing a whole life of living in my own mess is a process! Foster mom has figured out a system that helps me to be successful *most* of the time, so if you can take direction, I'll try my best to be good at your house too!\\n\\nSince I came to Colorado, I've been neutered AND I had 7 teeth removedboy, do I feel better after that! I'll need my teef brushed regularly to maintain my mouth health, but I'm a pretty chill dude so I'll make it easy for you! I like other dogs and since my mouth is better, I'll romp and play with just about anyone but it'd be best if I didn't have any little furry siblings (dogs under 20lbs, or cats). I've yet to meet a human I didn't love, including kids. Really, I'd love to be a part of a home that just wants to hang out with me - I'll happily sit on a coffee shop patio and keep you company, or will snuggle with you on the couch. I walk nicely on a leash (more like a mosey, anyway), don't know any obedience commands but will do just about anything for cookies, tolerate bath time, and love to sunbathe.\\n\\nIf you are interested in adopting Sully, please submit an adoption application located on our website, coloradocaninerescue.org.

He's 52 lbs. of mushball and is neutered and up to day with vaccines.  Poor Blue was saved after he was spotted tied up under a bridge in Brooklyn NY!  The finders didn't want to see him sent to the shelter so they took him to their home.  Unfortunately their landlord wants him out :(  This is what they have to say about this great boy - Blue is the sweetest, friendliest dog who loves everyone he meets and adores attention. His favorite thing to do is cuddle, and he will even try to sneak into bed in the middle of the night. He is happiest laying on top of people. He will gladly let people he doesn't even know pet him, and he wants to play with every dog he sees. He is good with other dogs when allowed to meet and play with them, but he will bark and pull towards dogs he sees while out walking, so we are looking for someone who will continue to work on his manners.  After all he's a very young dog and just needs structure. He is otherwise okay with walking on a leash but definitely needs some manners there as well as he gets so happy he tends to pull. Blue is generally mild-mannered and spends a lot of his day sleeping on the giant bean bag he's adopted as his bed.  He does have a lot of puppy energy as well so he will benefit greatly with a few good walks or runs a day. He likes to play with his ball, and he will bark to get someone to play with him. He loves to chew as most pups do but if he has a good chew toy or Nylabone to keep him busy he will be fine.  Just keep those shoes in the closet LOL as he may try to sneak one not understanding they are not his toy haha.  He's happy when new people come to visit the home. He is getting more acclimated to the crate, but he doesn't love it because he knows you're leaving,  But he is getting more and more used to a schedule so this should be worked out in no time. Overall, Blue is a very good and relatively easy dog. He is housebroken and friendly to all people, including kids. He is very affectionate, playful, and smart, and we think he's just the cutest, funniest dog we've ever met. Blue loves his reflection and will stop to look at himself in windows when we walk. He lets us pick him up and hold like him a baby. He likes to sit in our lap or lay on the back of the couch like a cat, and he sleeps on his back with his legs in the air awwwwww!!! With a bit of dedicated training (namely to improve his reactions to seeing dogs while on the leash), he will be the perfect addition to any family.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Average (suitable for an adopter with an average amount of experience) Note: see potential challenges section below Potential challenges: _X_Destructive behavior: Bruno is a young, active, enthusiastic dog with lots of energy. He will need daily mental and physical exercise and stimulation to channel that energy appropriately.

Cloud is still quite young and ebullient. He prefers nibbling on your ear to sitting quietly beside you. He'd rather pull than walk beside you.

He is extremely eager to please and will look up to his handler frequently to confirm his good work. Initially quite jumpy and invasive of space, Cloud now knows that the leash only comes on when he sits and is still. (The message was never received by his nonstop wagging tail, though.)\\nCloud is still very much a work in progress, but we feel he is ready for a home with adults who have strong (firm but fair) leadership skills with no small children. He hasn't been tested with cats.

       " 'LEROY, above all the other animals in our care, embodies the spirit of CompAnimals Pet Rescue and the level of commitment we give to our animals for their entire lives. Here is his story:\\n\\nAbout 10 years ago I got a call from a senior citizen who was trying to catch a stray pit bull in her neighborhood in Elkton. The dog would follow children around but eluded adults. She was worried the SPCA would pick him up and euthanize him. The Cecil Co SPCA had a \\\\\"no pit bulls\\\\\" policy at the time. So for 3 weeks I tried to catch him, make friends with him, bribe him and for 3 weeks the SPCA was bent on catching him as well. Luckily, with the help of a butcher (who lived in the same neighborhood and had been giving him fresh beef) I was able to capture him. He was super friendly and hopped right in my car. We had him vetted and aside from a hairless patch on the top of his head he recovered from his ordeal pretty quickly.\\n\\nI fostered him myself. He had a distinct hate of cats and for that reason I wasn\\'t able to keep him permanently. He did get along with other dogs and was a well mannered guest. It was probably a year or so before he found his \\\\\"forever\\\\\" home. Leroy seemed to have lucked out - he had a boy of his own and a big grassy yard. We didn\\'t hear much from him after the initial settling in. There were other dogs to rescue and Leroy was starting his new life.\\n\\nFast forward about 4 years - tragedy struck and Leroy\\'s family fell apart. His mom was sick, the house was in foreclosure, Leroy was living in an empty house. We got a call that the family could no longer care for him. Leroy came back.\\n\\nDue to the family\\'s lack of finances and the stress of it all, Leroy was in horrible shape. His skin condition which, looking back through vet records, had never been fully addressed. He was bald, scabby, bloody and thin. His head was sunken in. His hair loss was so great that you couldn\\'t even distinguish what color he was. He wagged his tail.\\n\\nAntibiotics and prednisone kicked back the skin a notch but again it never fully recovered. He developed demodex, a type of mange, due to the pred suppressing his immune system. We sent him to a foster home hoping to boost his spirits and give him more 1-on-1 care. Another vet was added to his repertoire. More antibiotics, supplements, shampoos but still his skin was slow to recover. Some prickly hair poked through but not as much as we had hoped for. He developed a sore on his ear and one on his toe which was so painful he didn\\'t want to walk. A culture was done and revealed not one, but 3, drug resistant bacteria. One was resistant to ALL antibiotics. The drugs that we had been giving him were slowly killing him.\\n\\nFast forward to a year ago, stopped all Western medicine and enlisted the help of Always Helpful Veterinary Services & Dr Judith Shoemaker. The first visit was hours long as she worked up a plan and refining of supplements, powders and remedies. I noticed her lack of concern at the \\\\\"flesh eating bacteria\\\\\" - a condition so bad that one vet wanted to amputate part of his ear and toe and another felt it was hopeless and he should be euthanized. She was most concerned with his painful eyes. He has a condition called entropean where the eyelids roll in and the lashes rub against the eye.\\n\\nLeroy responded quickly under the watchful eye of Dr. Shoemaker. His coat came in glossy and now covers about 2/3 of his body. His skin still has flare ups but not more drug resistant bacteria. He was tested for food allergies and put on an appropriate diet. To someone meeting Leroy today, for the first time, he looks like a wreck - like he was just rescued. But to those of us who have seen him in the road to recovery, he looks beautiful.\\n\\nLeroy has a pan pal who has him out every week for his medicated bath and some R&R. This same wonderful pen pal is covering most of his medical expenses (thankfully Always Helpful has a monthly payment plan!). She has offered to continue with his support even after he is adopted.\\n\\nLeroy is now pushing 10 years of age. We would love for him to find his special home but if not, he is welcome to live his life out with us. Somewhere along the line he decided he didn\\'t want to get along with other dogs - his Dr thinks it is because he felt so crappy. He has never lost his love of people - especially children. Leroy adores kids! He is currently getting a break from shelter life and is in a \\\\\"vacation\\\\\" foster home for a few weeks. Check out the video his foster mom made for him.\\n\\nIf you can be Leroy\\'s guardian angel please fill out an application at www.companimals.org',\n",

This makes them lovely family dogs and watchdogs, even for families with children, but they will need socialization training, especially as puppies to get along with unfamiliar humans or other dogs that stop by for a visit. Luckily, their intelligence makes them highly adaptable and trainable. The American Bulldog is a playful breed that has some high exercise needs, and they do well in families that are able to stay active with lots of walks and play time. They aren't the best breed to be kept in apartments or small spaces that don't allow for them to burn off energy. When they aren't physically or mentally stimulated, they can become destructive and chew on things they aren't supposed to. They CAN NOT be kept outside and are intolerant of heat. \\n\\nMcQueen, will make a wonderful family addition that is committed to a puppy, their energy, training needs and that us the right fit for his breed.

       " \"Atlas is a 21 month old male American Bulldog/Pointer mix (our best guess) that is 86 pounds. He needs to be in a home with no other alpha male dogs. He does fine with small male dogs. He is very attached and loves to be with you. He is extremely found of kids. Kids seem to be his favorite thing. Just wants to be with them. He is fine with cats. He will jump a fence shorter than 8 ft. So will need a tie out, electric fence or leashed to go out. He is very well trained on the electric fence. He is completely potty-trained. He loves to sleep in bed with you on your head. He is a calm dog and loves to relax on a couch or chair. He does get spurts of energy where he wants to play as he is still puppy.

even fearful of some humans or just lean into you as he melts to the floor with his belly up for affection because he can be fearful of some people its important to give him space and go slow with introductions he has met older children and enjoyed their calm attention but to help him with his excitability he prefers a home with older children he has blossomed with positive dog training no force no fear no pain and build his confidence while strengthening your bond finn is seeking his human soulmate he is an amazing young boy  is waiting patiently for the right home  other dogs currently if we cant avoid a dog during our walk then we keep a safe distance like on the other side of the street in a calm voice tell him he is a good boy watch  we toss a treat in the air for him to catch we allow finn to watch the dog but break his stare with something positive to change the experience this also helps him refocus his energies to something delicious with some dogs this has worked well there are still some dogs that he reacts to due to fear  finn tends to be intimidated by large dogs  cant help but want to chase small dogs which is completely natural for northern breeds he has met playful females and has done well with a slow introduction he has also met some that made him fearful    inside the house  finn is calm inside the house as long as he gets a nice walk we also give him a frozen toy filled with chicken broth  a couple of treats which he loves to lick licking is very soothing to dogs  helps them stay busy he enjoys chewing  licking toys we always leave his crate open and he is kept in a gated area during the day which is the kitchen as well as finns den he is a very good boy  tries not to counter surf he enjoys jumping on furniture  can learn which
