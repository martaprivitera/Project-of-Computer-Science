# Project-of-Computer-Science

This repository contains the Computer Science Project developed by Eleonora Brambatti, Camilla Fracchia and Marta Privitera during the Academic Year 2022-23.

# Content

There are four files:

- dogs.csv, *shortly dogs*
- dogTravel.csv, *shortly travels*
- NST-EST2021-POP.csv
- Proj_Brambatti_Fracchia_Privitera.ipynb.

We developed the project in 'Proj_Brambatti_Fracchia_Privitera.ipynb.' by answering twelves questions. Each question is a specific issue that we solved using Python language and 'pandas' library.


# Instructions:

- It is mandatory to use GitHub for developing the project.
- The project must be a jupyter notebook.
- There is no restriction on the libraries that can be used, nor on the Python version.
- All questions on the project must be asked in a public channel on Zulip.
- At most 3 students can be in each group. You must create the groups by yourself.
- You do not have to send me the project before the discussion.
